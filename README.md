[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/pm2.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/pm2)

The next generation daemon process manager for Node.js with native clusterization.

PM2 is mainly a production module for Linux servers.

Tested with Node v0.8, v0.10, v0.11

# Installation

```
npm install -g pm2
```

# Usage/Features

```
$ npm install pm2 -g     // Install pm2 command line globally
$ pm2 start app.js -i 4  // Daemonize pm2 and Start 4 clustered instances of app.js
                         // You can also pass the 'max' params to start 
                         // the right numbers of processes depending of CPUs
$ pm2 list               // Display all processes status
$ pm2 monit              // Monitor all processes
$ pm2 logs               // Display all processes logs in streaming
$ pm2 dump               // Dump the states of all processes
$ pm2 stop pm2_id        // Stop specific process id
$ pm2 stopAll            // Stop all processes
$ pm2 resurrect           // Put online previously dumped processes
$ pm2 restart pm2_id     // Restart specific process
$ pm2 restartAll         // Restart all proccesses
$ pm2 stopAll
$ pm2 generate app       // Generate a JSON process configuration
$ pm2 web                // Health computer API endpoint (http://localhost:9615)
```

## Differents way of starting a process

```
$ pm2 start app.js -i max  // Will start maximum processes depending on CPU availables
$ pm2 start app.js -i 3    // Will start 3 processes
$ pm2 start app.json       // Start processes with options declared in app.json
                           // Go to chapter Multi process JSON declaration for more
                           
$ pm2 start app.js -i max -- -a 23 // Pass arguments after -- to app.js
$ pm2 start app.js -i max -e err.log -o out.log -w // Will start and generate a configuration file
```

## Updating pm2 procedure (and keeping processes alive)

```
$ pm2 dump
$ npm install -g pm2@latest
$ pm2 kill
$ pm2 resurrect
```

## Is my production server ready for PM2 ?

Just try the tests before using PM2 on your production server

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Unitech/pm2.git
$ cd pm2
$ npm install --dev
$ npm test
```

If a test is broken please report us issues [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues?state=open)

## pm2 list

List infos about all processes managed by pm2. It shows also how many times a process has been restarted because of an unhandled exception.

## pm2 monit

Monitor CPU and memory usage of every node process (and also clustered processes) managed by pm2.

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-monit.png)

## pm2 logs

Display logs in streaming of all processes, without having to do a tail -f or something else.

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-logs.png)

## pm2 dump/resurrect

You can dump all currently running processes, including their environment and execution path.
After restarting or stopping PM2 you can `resurrect` them.

## pm2 health web api endpoint

PM2 can disserve an API endpoint to monitor processes and computer health (cpu usage, memory, network interfaces...)

```
pm2 web
```

# Features

- Clusterize your Node networked script without adding one line of code
- Fully tested
- Monitor process/cluster processes health (status, memory, cpu usage, restarted time) via CLI (htop like)
- Monitor server health (processes, cpu core...) via JSON api (pm2 web)
- Launch multiple applications via JSON
- Forever keep alive processes
- Log streaming in realtime (pm2 logs)
- Log uncaught exceptions in error logs
- Track restarted time
- Auto stop processes who exit too fast
- Dump current processes and resurrect (upstart)

# Multi process JSON declaration

processes.json : 

```
[{
    "name"      : "echo",
    "script"    : "./examples/echo.js",
    "max"       : "10",
    "instances" : "max",
    "args"      : "-d 1"
},{
    "name"      : "api",
    "script"    : "./examples/child.js",
    "instances" : "4"
},{
    "name"      : "bus",
    "script"    : "./examples/echokill.js"
}]
```

Then with the cli :
```
$ pm2 start processes.json
```

# Test

```
npm test
```

# Next Features

- Remote administration/status checking
- Builtin Inter process communication channel (message bus)
- Auto start of the script at start (upstart)
- V8 GC memory leak detection
- Web interface
- Keeping monitoring data
- Integrated wrk utils endpoint benchmark

# Install a process (draft, not implemented)

You can install processes and communicate with them
```
$ m2 install web-pm2
$ m2 list
$ m2 start web-pm2
$ m2 info web-pm2    // list 
```

- Add homogen communication channel (pubsub/eventemitter2 - wildcard events) (axon pub/sub-message.js)
